# vagrant
##Vagrant Crash Course In Class Assignment:
We will be simulating a real-life example of a development team working on a PHP project.  Each team will have an exact replica of the production environment and each member will submit a file to the repo.
1.	Following my slides instructions, create a LAMP stack development environment on your machine.
2.	In your project folder, clone my repo and provision vagrant using my shared environment
3.	Create a simple your_last_name.php in your project directory file using the sample.php template you pulled from my repo.
4.	Push the content of your project my repo.
5.	Make sure you exclude the vagrantfile from your pushed code
